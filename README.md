Credit card fraud detection is a binary classification problem where fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate ones.
This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions while handling severe class imbalance.

The key challenge addressed is improving fraud detection performance beyond accuracy, using appropriate preprocessing, resampling techniques, and evaluation metrics.
